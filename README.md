# Music-Audio-Classification-Using-ML-and-DL-Techniques

Music Genre Classification using Deep Learning: Conducted a comprehensive study on a
TensorFlow dataset containing 10 music genres, each comprising 1000 audio tracks of 30
seconds duration from the GTZAN dataset. Explored and implemented three deep
learning models, namely CNN, ANN, and RNN with LSTM using the library Librosa for
music genre classification. The CNN outperformed other models with 76% accuracy.
Through rigorous experimentation, evaluated and compared the performance of these
models in accurately classifying audio files into their respective genres. The project
demonstrates expertise in deep learning architectures, TensorFlow, and showcases the
ability to handle large-scale audio data for music genre classification tasks.
